# mini3d

3D software rendering tutorial, without any performance optimization, mainly explains how to write a fixed pipeline software renderer. Although the main code is only 700 lines, it is small but complete.

## Features

* Single File: The source code consists of only one file, mini3d.c, which implements all the functionality. It is easy to read and understand.
* Independent Compilation: There is no third-party library dependency and no complex project directory.
* Model Standard: Uses the standard D3D coordinate model, left-handed system with WORLD/VIEW/PROJECTION matrices.
* Clipping Implementation: Implements simple CVV (Canonical View Volume) clipping.
* Texture Support: Supports textures up to a maximum of 1024 x 1024.
* Depth Buffering: Uses a depth buffer to determine the order of image rendering.
* Perspective Texture Mapping: Implements perspective texture mapping and perspective color filling.
* Edge Calculation: Accurately calculates polygon edge coverage.
* Simplified Implementation: The rendering engine consists of only 700 lines of code, with clear modules and a prominent main structure.
* Detailed Comments: The primary code is well-documented with detailed comments.

## Compile

* mingw: 
		gcc -O3 mini3d.c -o mini3d.exe -lgdi32
* msvc:
		cl -O2 -nologo mini3d.c 
* Compiled version:

## Basic TO-DO:

* Add backface culling
* Implement simple lighting
* Provide more rendering modes
* Implement texture sampling with bicubic interpolation

## Advanced TO-DO:

* Derive and prove all geometric knowledge used in the program
* Optimize vertex computation performance
* Optimize draw_scanline performance
* Load textures from BMP/TGA files
* Load BSP scenes and implement roaming.
